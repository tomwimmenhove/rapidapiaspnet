Dotnet template for an RapidAPI Asp.NET application.

Install with:

```
dotnet new install ./
```

Set the `SecretValue` in the `Auth` section of the `appsettings.json` file
to the correct `X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Secret` found on the RapidAPI provider page
for the corresponding API under the "Security" tab and you're good to go.
